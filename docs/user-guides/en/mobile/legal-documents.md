- It protects both you and us

### When Documents Are Updated

Occasionally, we update our legal documents. When this happens:

1. You'll see a notification when you open the app
2. A summary of changes will be shown
3. You'll need to review and accept the new version
4. The app will remember which version you accepted

> **Note:** For significant changes to how we handle health data, we'll always ask for your explicit consent again.

## Your Data Rights

Under Swiss and EU law, you have the right to:

| Right | What It Means | How to Exercise |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Access** | Get a copy of your data | Settings > Privacy > Export Data |
| **Rectification** | Correct inaccurate data | Edit in app or contact support |
| **Erasure** | Delete your data | Settings > Account > Delete Account |
| **Portability** | Get data in machine-readable format | Settings > Privacy > Export Data |
| **Withdraw Consent** | Stop us processing your health data | Settings > Privacy > Manage Consent |

## Health Data Special Protections

Your health and recovery data receives special protection:

- **Encryption:** All health data is encrypted using AES-256
- **No Selling:** We never sell your health data
- **No Ads:** We don't use your data for advertising
- **Limited Access:** Only essential staff can access data (for support)
- **AI Processing:** When AI analyzes your data, it's anonymized first

## Questions About Legal Documents

### Why do I need to accept terms again?

We updated our legal documents. You need to review and accept the new version to continue using the app. This ensures you're always informed about how we operate.

### Can I use Altea if I don't agree?

Unfortunately, no. Accepting our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy is required to use Altea. This is because we need legal permission to process your health data.

### What happens to my data if I don't accept updates?

Your data remains safe. However, you won't be able to use the app until you accept the updated terms. You can always request your data be exported or deleted.

### How do I know when legal documents change?

- You'll receive an email notification
- You'll see an in-app notification
- The app will prompt you to review changes

### Where can I file a complaint?

If you believe we've mishandled your data:

**Switzerland:**
- Federal Data Protection Commissioner (FDPIC)
- Website: www.edoeb.admin.ch

**EU:**
- Your local Data Protection Authority
